# Hackpad
Hackpad is a 3 key macropad with a rotary encoder. It also has 1 SK6812 MINI-E LED, and uses KMK firmware.

# Features:
<ul>
  <li>EC11 Rotary encoder for whatever you want (personaly i will use it for a volume knob)</li>
  <li>1 SK6812 MINI-E LED</li>
  <li>3 Switches/Keys for any purpose you want</li>
</ul>

# CAD Model:
Everything fits together using 4 M3x16mm Bolts and M3x5mx4mm heatset inserts for the case.

It has 2 separate printed pieces. The base where the PCB sits and the top cover.

# Firmware
This hackpad uses KMK firmware for everything.

<ul>
  <li>The rotary encoder changes volume. Press to play/pause.</li>
  <li>The 3 keys currently type 1, 2 and 3. However I can dynamically change the code.</li>
  <li>The mini LED is just ON as a static light with a red color.</li>
</ul>
